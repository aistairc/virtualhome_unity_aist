## Known Issues

* Female1 character doesn't have similar bone hierarchy as the other characters, especially the hands. We can fix this by it's not our priority right now so don't use it. 
* Upper body animations (talking/texting on a phone and drinking) looks unnatural when the character is sitting. This is due to using some IK to make char sit properlly on seats with different heights. This IK changes the animation to make it look more natural but at the same time, the IK prevents adjusting drinking animation look natural.
