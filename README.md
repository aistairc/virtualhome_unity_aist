# VirtualHome Unity Source Code
This repository is made up of the script files only. A completed Unity project will include other files like scenes, prefabs, animations, project setting and so on. If you want the complete project file, you have to contact the project supervisors.

If you are looking for a simulator to execute along with the [VirtualHome API of AIST](https://github.com/aistairc/virtualhome_aist), you can download from the [releases](https://github.com/aistairc/virtualhome_unity_aist/releases). 

You can take a reference to the original VirtualHome Unity Source Code from [here](https://github.com/xavierpuigf/virtualhome_unity) if you want.
